               <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
               <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.  JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons.  It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developes to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
               <div class="list">
                  <ul>
                     <li><a target="_blank" href="">Variable Declaration</a> Javascript variables are contrainers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.  These unique names are called identifiers. <span>var x;</span></li>
                     <li><a target="_blank" href="">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable,<span> var x = 10;</span></li>
                     <li><a target="_blank" href="">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span>true</span> or <span>false; </span>null - <span>null </span>aka nothing; Number - <span>42</span> or <span>3.14159;</span> String - <span>"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span>[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span>{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span></li>
                     <li><a target="_blank" href="">Conditionals</a> When you write code you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this.  There are the following conditional statements: <span>if</span> a special condition is true, do this in our code block; <span>else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, <span>if</span> the first condition is false, else we execute this clock of code;</li>
                     <li><a target="_blank" href="">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop.  That's a loop!</li>
                     <li><a target="_blank" href="">Function</a> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block.  Think of it as a list of instructions.  As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instructions manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place hte table the right way up.  DOne!  We finished our instructions.  Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
